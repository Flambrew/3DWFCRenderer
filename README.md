# 3DWFCRenderer
Renderer for 2- and 3-dimensional landscapes progressively generated utilizing the wave function collapse algorithm.

## Project Goals
This project seeks to merge two unfinished projects of mine, a 3D voxel graphics and physics engine and a 2D progressive image generator using the wave function collapse algorithm.
In its finished state, it should include:
1. A two-dimensional image generator that can create images from not only a list of seed images but also from a single image processed and emulated in real-time
2. A three-dimensional voxel landscape generator that can create landscapes from a list of voxel-style chunks
3. A three-dimensional graphics renderer and physics engine with which to view and explore said landscapes
    - In the case of 2D outputs, there should be a sample theater area where one can view the image rendered on a wall
4. A system capable of writing generated outputs to a variety of image or 3D model file formats, as appropriate
